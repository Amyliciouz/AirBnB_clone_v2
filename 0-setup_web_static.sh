# a Bash script that sets up your web servers for the deployment of web_static. It must:

Install Nginx if it not already installed
Create the folder /data/ if it doesn’t already exist
Create the folder /data/web_static/ if it doesn’t already exist
Create the folder /data/web_static/releases/ if it doesn’t already exist
Create the folder /data/web_static/shared/ if it doesn’t already exist
Create the folder /data/web_static/releases/test/ if it doesn’t already exist
Create a fake HTML file /data/web_static/releases/test/index.html (with simple content, to test your Nginx configuration)
Create a symbolic link /data/web_static/current linked to the /data/web_static/releases/test/ folder. If the symbolic link already exists, it should be deleted and recreated every time the script is ran.
# give ownership of the /data/ folder to the ubuntu user AND group (you can assume this user and group exist). This should be recursive; everything inside should be created/owned by this user/group.
# update the Nginx configuration to serve the content of /data/web_static/current/ to hbnb_static (ex: https://mydomainname.tech/hbnb_static). Don’t forget to restart Nginx after updating the configuration:
# Use alias inside your Nginx configuration

sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y nginx
mkdir -p /data
mkdir -p /data/web_static
mkdir -p /data/web_static/releases
mkdir -p /data/web_static/shared
mkdir -p /data/web_static/releases/test
touch /data/web_static/releases/test/index.html
ln -sf /data/web_static/test  /data/web_static/current 
chown -R ubuntu:ubuntu /data
